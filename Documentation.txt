Game 1 - Original - Chase game

Goal is to survive the longest and not get caught.
Enemy speed increases by 0.1 every 100 points.

Features:
Accepts keyboard inputs: A, D and arrow keys. Also accepts mouse clicks and touch
Restart button restarts the game.
I added music that I have commercial licence for.
The game adjusts itself according to the screen size.


Challenges:
More features such as powerups were getting very challenging.

Game 2 - Open Source - Breakout Game

He used shapes to draw elements, I used pictures.
If enemies touch the floor game restarts or the ball.
I made the game playable on phones where you can touch and hold the floor.
I made sure the game adjusted on every single screen as his only had fixed dimensions
I added difficulty where the enemies keep coming closer to the the floor and if they touch the floor it's game over. but I also added infinite replayabliity where the game keeps going on forever with increase ball size and enemy speed.

Challenges:
Keeping track of all the enemies and moving ball. The x and y positions for collision was very challenging to get down.

Game 3 - Original - Jump game

The idea behind this game is that it is unfair. Platforms appear randomly every second. player needs to land on them.

The game adjusts itself according to the screen size.
This game uses mostly the same code as Game 1 with the addition of platforms and jumps.
